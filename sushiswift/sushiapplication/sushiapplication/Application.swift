/**

 `Application` class

 Object that intiialises Sushi.

 - This object should be only initialised once. Usually at `main.swift` file.

 - Use `initialise(with:initiCallback:)` to initialise the application.

 - Use `Application.instance` to get the necessary properties such as the `driver`, `graphicsDevice`, and `storageManager`.

 - Use `spawnWindow(logic:title:at:)` to create a window. **DO NOT INITIALISE BY CREATING A WINDOW INSTANCE**
